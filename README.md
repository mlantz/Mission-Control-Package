## Requirements

1. PHP 7.1+

### Composer

```php
composer require diegodevgroup/mission-control
```

### IssueService

IssueService lets you peak into your exceptions or any flagged messages you'd like to track. You can do so using the following methods:

```
use Diegodevgroup\MissionControl\IssueService;

try {
    // do some code
} catch (Exception $e) {
    $issueService = new IssueService('{API Token}');
    $issueService->exception($e);
}
```

Or if you just want to flag an potential issue or concern in your applicaiton:

```
use Diegodevgroup\MissionControl\IssueService;

$issueService = new IssueService('{API Token}');
$issueService->log('Anything you want to say goes here', 'flag');
```

##### Flags

Flags can be any terminology you want, to help sort through your issues.

### WebhookService

You can easily tie the webhooks into your application with this package using class and method:

```
use Diegodevgroup\MissionControl\WebhookService;

(new WebhookService('{your-projects-webhook}'))->send('This is a title', 'This is a custom message', 'info');
```

### PerformanceService

Add this cron job to enable PerformanceService which scans your system to report back to mission control the state of your server.

```
*/5 * * * * /{app-path}/vendor/bin/performance {API token}
```

### TrafficService

Want to track some basic inforation about your web traffic? You'll need to make sure you've enabled `access.log` tracking, then add this cron job to your server.

```
*/5 * * * * /{app-path}/vendor/bin/traffic {API token} {path-to-access.log} {format --optional (nginx default)}
```

#### TrafficService formats

nginx: %a %l %u %t "%m %U %H" %>s %O "%{Referer}i" \"%{User-Agent}i"
apache: %h %l %u %t "%r" %>s %b

#### Quick tip for Forge users

This simple command can enable your access logs after you restart Ngnix.

```
sudo su
sed -i -e 's/access_log off;/access_log \/var\/log\/nginx\/{domain}-access.log;/g' /etc/nginx/sites-available/{domain}
```

Your log should then be `/var/log/nginx/{domain}-access.log`
